# Epic 7, Story 7.2: Comments System - Display - QA Review

**Story**: Epic 7, Story 7.2 - Comments System: Display
**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Developer**: Dev Agent
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete comments display system for SteppersLife Magazine articles, featuring:
- Comment list display with nested replies (up to 2 levels)
- Authentication-aware UI
- Relative time formatting
- Empty state handling
- Comment count display

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created

1. **`/utils/date.ts`** - Date utility functions
   - `formatRelativeTime()` - Converts dates to human-readable format ("2h ago", "3d ago")
   - Handles various time intervals from seconds to months
   - Returns formatted date string for older dates

2. **`/components/articles/comment-item.tsx`** - Individual comment component
   - Client component for displaying single comments
   - Supports recursive rendering for nested replies (max depth 2)
   - Shows avatar, author name, timestamp, content
   - Visual indentation for reply hierarchy (2.5rem per level)
   - Placeholder Like/Reply buttons (non-interactive in Story 7.2)

3. **`/components/articles/comments-list.tsx`** - Comments list container
   - Client component managing comment display
   - Organizes flat comment array into hierarchical structure
   - Shows comment count in header
   - Authentication-aware: "Sign in to comment" for guests
   - Empty state: "No comments yet. Be the first to comment!"
   - Placeholder for comment form (Story 7.3)

### Files Modified

4. **`/lib/articles.ts`** - Added comment fetching function
   - `getArticleComments(articleId)` - Fetches approved comments
   - Returns only `isApproved: true` comments
   - Ordered by creation date (newest first)
   - Includes user data (name, photo)

5. **`/app/(public)/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Updated article page
   - Imports auth and comments components
   - Fetches comments via `getArticleComments()`
   - Checks authentication status via `await auth()`
   - Passes data to `<CommentsList>` component
   - Replaced placeholder with functional comments section

6. **`/prisma/seed.ts`** - Added sample comments
   - Created 4 sample commenter users with avatars
   - Added 9 comments across 3 published articles:
     - Soul Brothers (5 comments with nested replies)
     - Census 2024 (2 comments)
     - Politics & Power (2 comments with 1 reply)
   - Uses `upsert` to handle re-runs gracefully
   - Clears existing comments before seeding

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Display Comments List Under Article
- All approved comments (`isApproved: true`) are displayed
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)
- Comment count shown in header: "Comments (5)"

### ✅ Nested Replies Support
- Parent comments with child replies
- 1-2 levels of nesting supported
- Visual indentation: 2.5rem per level
- Border-left visual indicator for reply threads

### ✅ Comment Metadata
- Author name and avatar (with fallback initials)
- Post date in relative time format:
  - "just now" (< 30 seconds)
  - "Xs ago" (< 1 minute)
  - "Xm ago" (< 1 hour)
  - "Xh ago" (< 1 day)
  - "Xd ago" (< 1 week)
  - Full date (> 1 week)
- Like count display (placeholder, no interaction)

### ✅ Authentication-Aware Display
- Guest users: "Sign in to comment" button with link to `/sign-in`
- Authenticated users: Placeholder for comment form (Story 7.3)
- Uses NextAuth v5 SSO pattern: `const session = await auth()`

### ✅ Empty State
- Shows when no comments exist
- Icon + message: "No comments yet. Be the first to comment!"
- Clean, centered design

## Technical Details

### SSO Authentication Pattern
```typescript
const session = await auth()
const isAuthenticated = !!session?.user
```
- No permission checks needed for viewing comments
- Authentication only checked to show appropriate UI

### Comment Data Structure
```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string
  content: string
  userName: string
  userPhoto?: string | null
  createdAt: Date | string
  parentId?: string | null
  replies?: Comment[]
}
```

### Hierarchical Organization
- Flat array from database converted to nested structure
- Two-pass algorithm:
  1. Create map of all comments with empty replies array
  2. Nest replies under parent comments
- Root comments (parentId: null) at top level

## Database Schema Used

```prisma
model Comment {
  id        String  @id @default(cuid())
  articleId String
  userId    String
  content   String
  userName  String
  userPhoto String?
  parentId  String?

  isApproved Boolean @default(true)
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())

  article Article @relation(...)
  user    User @relation(...)
  parent  Comment? @relation("CommentReplies", ...)
  replies Comment[] @relation("CommentReplies")
}
```

## Testing Results
