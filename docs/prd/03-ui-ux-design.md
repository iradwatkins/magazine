## 3.1 Overall UX Vision

The platform delivers a **premium, editorial-quality experience** that rivals traditional print magazines while embracing modern digital capabilities. The design aesthetic draws inspiration from iconic Black magazines like _Ebony_ and _Jet_, featuring sophisticated typography, generous whitespace, and gold accent touches that evoke luxury and cultural celebration. The interface prioritizes **clarity over clutter**, allowing content to shine while providing powerful tools that stay out of the creator's way until needed.

For content creators, the editor experience feels **intuitive and liberating**—like working with physical magazine layouts but with digital superpowers. For readers, articles feel **immersive and intentional**, with every typographic choice and layout decision serving the story.

## 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

**Editor Experience:**

- **Direct Manipulation:** Drag-and-drop as primary interaction—blocks are physical objects users can grab, move, and arrange
- **Contextual Tools:** Formatting options appear only when needed (hover states, selection toolbars)
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Basic block settings visible by default; advanced options revealed in inspector panel
- **Immediate Feedback:** Changes reflect instantly; auto-save indicator provides confidence

**Reader Experience:**

- **Distraction-Free Reading:** Clean article pages with typography optimized for long-form reading
- **Effortless Navigation:** Sticky header, smooth scrolling, intuitive category browsing
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core content accessible without JavaScript; enhancements layer on top
- **Touch-First Mobile:** Large tap targets, swipe gestures, thumb-zone optimization

**Admin Dashboard:**

- **Information Density:** Table/list views for efficient content management
- **Batch Operations:** Multi-select for bulk actions when managing many articles
- **Quick Actions:** Inline editing and status changes without page navigation

## 3.3 Core Screens and Views

**Content Creation (Editor):**

1. **Article Editor Canvas** - Full-screen drag-and-drop workspace with block palette sidebar
2. **Article Settings Panel** - Featured image, category, tags, SEO, publish status
3. **Media Library Modal** - Grid view of uploaded images with search/filter
4. **Block Inspector Panel** - Context-specific settings for selected block

**Content Management (Admin Dashboard):** 5. **Dashboard Overview** - Recent articles, quick stats, recent activity feed 6. **Article List View** - Searchable/filterable table of all articles with inline actions 7. **Category Management** - CRUD interface for categories with drag-to-reorder 8. **User Management** - List of users with roles, permissions, and profile editing

**Reader Experience (Public Site):** 9. **Homepage** - Hero featured article + grid of latest articles 10. **Article Detail Page** - Full article with optimized reading experience 11. **Category Landing Page** - Category description + filtered article grid 12. **Author Profile Page** - Author bio + all articles by that author

## 3.4 Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

The platform shall conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards, ensuring:

- Semantic HTML structure throughout
- ARIA labels for interactive components
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- Screen reader compatibility tested with NVDA/JAWS
- Color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, ≥ 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators visible and distinct
- Alt text required for all images (enforced in editor)
- Form labels properly associated with inputs

## 3.5 Branding

**Design System Foundation:**

- **Color Palette:** Professional blues (#1e9df1 primary) with sophisticated gold accents (#d4af37) inspired by classic Black magazines like _Ebony_ and _Jet_
- **Typography:**
  - **Serif (Georgia)** for article headlines and body text—editorial, timeless feel
  - **Sans-serif (Open Sans)** for UI, navigation, metadata—modern, readable
  - **Monospace (Menlo)** for code blocks if needed
- **Spacing & Layout:** Generous whitespace, max article width 720px for optimal reading, 1.3rem border radius for modern softness
- **Theme Support:** Light theme by default (white background, dark text); dark mode deferred to post-MVP
- **Visual Identity:** Clean, sophisticated, culturally resonant—celebrating Black excellence without stereotypes

**Brand Personality:**

- Premium yet accessible
- Modern yet timeless
- Bold yet refined
- Celebratory yet substantive

## 3.6 Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive (Mobile-First)

**Primary Targets:**

- **Mobile (< 768px):** iPhone/Android smartphones—optimized for reading on commute, casual browsing
- **Tablet (768-1024px):** iPad/Android tablets—comfortable reading + light editing
- **Desktop (> 1024px):** Laptop/desktop browsers—primary editor experience, full dashboard capabilities

**Technical Approach:**

- **Mobile-first CSS:** Base styles for mobile, progressively enhanced for larger screens
- **Responsive breakpoints:**
  - Small: 0-767px (single column, hamburger menu, touch-optimized)
  - Medium: 768-1023px (two columns where appropriate, expanded navigation)
  - Large: 1024px+ (full layout, sidebar panels, multi-column grids)
- **Touch-friendly:** 44x44px minimum tap targets, touch-optimized drag-and-drop
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) ready:** Deferred to post-MVP but architecture supports it

**Browser Support:**

- **Modern browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)
- **No IE11 support**—focus on modern standards
