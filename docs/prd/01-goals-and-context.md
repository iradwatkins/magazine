## 1.1 Goals

- Enable non-technical content creators to design and publish editorial-quality articles using an intuitive drag-and-drop editor with essential content blocks
- Build complete article management system with user roles, categories, tags, and publish/draft workflow
- Deliver a premium, fast-loading reading experience across all devices with homepage, article pages, and category browsing
- Implement full media management with MinIO integration for image uploads and optimization
- Establish scalable foundation on self-hosted infrastructure for future feature expansion
- Celebrate Black culture, excellence, and storytelling through a sophisticated digital magazine platform

## 1.2 Background Context

The digital publishing landscape has evolved significantly, yet many content management systems remain complex and require technical expertise. Content creators—especially those transitioning from print media—struggle with platforms that offer limited design flexibility and cumbersome multimedia formatting.

This project addresses the need for a **modern, sophisticated online magazine platform** that empowers editors and writers to create visually stunning, editorial-quality content without technical barriers. The platform will specifically celebrate Black culture and storytelling, filling a gap in the market for premium digital magazines that combine ease of use with professional-grade publishing tools. By leveraging modern self-hosted infrastructure and a drag-and-drop editor, the platform will enable rapid content creation while maintaining editorial quality and performance. The MVP delivers a complete, production-ready publishing platform with all core functionality needed to launch and operate a professional online magazine.
