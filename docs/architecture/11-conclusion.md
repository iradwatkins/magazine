This architecture document provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing the SteppersLife Magazine platform with a **fully isolated, self-hosted infrastructure**. Key highlights:

1. **Complete Isolation**: Magazine runs on dedicated containers with zero shared resources
2. **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MinIO
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with TypeScript and Prisma
4. **Performance**: Server-first rendering, Redis caching, image optimization
5. **Security**: Multi-layer security with auth, validation, rate limiting, and isolation
6. **Scalability**: Containerized architecture allows independent scaling
7. **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, type checking, auto-save, comprehensive testing

**Domain Structure:**

- Main app: `magazine.stepperslife.com` (Port 3007)
- Media storage: `media.magazine.stepperslife.com` (MinIO Port 9007)

**Infrastructure:**

- `magazine-app` container (Next.js)
- `magazine-postgres` container (PostgreSQL 16)
- `magazine-redis` container (Redis 7)
- `magazine-minio` container (MinIO latest)

All services run on isolated Docker network with dedicated volumes and unique port mappings to prevent any conflicts with other SteppersLife properties.
