## 1.1 Overview

This architecture document defines the technical implementation for a modern online magazine platform celebrating Black culture, excellence, and storytelling. The platform enables non-technical content creators to design and publish editorial-quality articles using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface while delivering a premium reading experience across all devices.

The architecture follows a **self-hosted, fully isolated infrastructure approach**, leveraging Next.js 15+ with App Router for a unified full-stack TypeScript application. The magazine platform runs completely independently on its own dedicated infrastructure with no shared resources with other SteppersLife properties.

## 1.2 Starter Template Analysis

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a custom-built solution without relying on pre-existing starter templates. While frameworks like T3 Stack or create-t3-app provide excellent foundations for Next.js applications, the specific requirements of this project—particularly the fully isolated self-hosted infrastructure, custom drag-and-drop editor with TipTap, and dedicated PostgreSQL/MinIO setup—warrant a tailored approach.

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **Isolation-first**: Magazine platform runs on dedicated containers with zero shared resources
- **Type-safe**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma ORM for compile-time safety
- **Component-driven**: Reusable UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Progressive enhancement**: Server-first rendering with client-side interactivity where needed
- **Accessibility-first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance baked into every component
