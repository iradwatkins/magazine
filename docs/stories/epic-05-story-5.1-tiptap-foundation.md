# Story 5.1: Set Up TipTap Rich Text Editor Foundation

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Drag-and-Drop Article Editor
**Story ID:** 5.1
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Agent Model Used:** claude-sonnet-4-5

---

## User Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to install and configure TipTap editor as the foundation for text editing,
**So that** content creators have a powerful, extensible rich text editing experience.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- Technology: TipTap v2 (React wrapper), StarterKit extensions
- Follows pattern: Existing component architecture in `components/` directory
- Touch points: Will be used by Article Editor (Story 5.12), Paragraph Block (5.7), Quote Block (5.7)

**Epic Context:**
This is the **first story** in Epic 5. It establishes the rich text editing foundation that all subsequent text-based blocks will use. This story has no dependencies on other Epic 5 stories but builds on the foundation from Epic 1-4.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **TipTap Core Installation:**
   - Install `@tiptap/react` and `@tiptap/starter-kit` packages
   - Install additional extensions: `@tiptap/extension-placeholder`, `@tiptap/extension-character-count`
   - Verify dependencies in `package.json`

2. **Basic TipTap Editor Component:**
   - Create test component at `components/editor/tiptap-editor.tsx`
   - Editor renders successfully in test page
   - Editor accepts initial content prop
   - Editor emits onChange events with updated content

3. **Editor Configuration:**
   - Configure with extensions: Bold, Italic, Underline, Heading (H1-H6), BulletList, OrderedList, Link
   - Placeholder text shows when editor is empty
   - Character count tracks content length
   - Editor content serializes to JSON format
   - Editor content deserializes from JSON format

4. **Styling & Design System:**
   - Editor uses Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Typography matches design system (font families, sizes, line heights)
   - Focus states styled with primary color
   - Editor has proper padding and spacing

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Cmd/Ctrl+B toggles bold
   - Cmd/Ctrl+I toggles italic
   - Cmd/Ctrl+U toggles underline
   - Cmd/Ctrl+K opens link dialog
   - All shortcuts work as expected

6. **Accessibility:**
   - Editor is keyboard navigable
   - ARIA labels present for toolbar buttons
   - Screen reader announces formatting changes
   - Focus visible on all interactive elements

### Integration Requirements

7. **Component Structure:**
   - Component follows existing React component patterns
   - Props interface properly typed with TypeScript
   - Component is reusable and composable
   - No breaking changes to existing components

8. **JSON Serialization:**
   - Content saves to/loads from JSON format
   - JSON structure compatible with TipTap schema
   - Content can be stored in database (tested with sample data)

### Quality Requirements

9. **Testing:**
   - Test page created at `app/(admin)/test/tiptap/page.tsx` for manual testing
   - Basic functionality verified: typing, formatting, shortcuts
   - JSON serialization/deserialization tested
   - Component renders without errors

## Technical Notes

### TipTap Configuration

```typescript
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      heading: {
        levels: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
      },
    }),
    Placeholder.configure({
      placeholder: 'Start typing...',
    }),
    CharacterCount,
    Link.configure({
      openOnClick: false,
    }),
    Underline,
  ],
  content: initialContent,
  onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
    onChange?.(editor.getJSON())
  },
})
```

### Component Props Interface

```typescript
interface TipTapEditorProps {
  content?: JSONContent
  onChange?: (content: JSONContent) => void
  placeholder?: string
  editable?: boolean
  className?: string
}
```

### Integration Approach

- Component will be used by multiple block types (Paragraph, Quote, Heading)
- Must be flexible enough to support different use cases
- Keep component simple and focused on core editing
- Advanced features (toolbar, formatting panel) will be added in later stories

### Key Constraints

- Must use TipTap v2 (latest stable)
- Must integrate with Next.js App Router (server/client components)
- Must be TypeScript strict mode compatible
- No custom toolbar in this story (Story 5.7 will add toolbar)

---

## Risk and Compatibility

### Primary Risk

TipTap version compatibility issues or conflicts with Next.js App Router (client/server components).

### Mitigation

- Use latest stable TipTap v2 version
- Mark component with 'use client' directive
- Test thoroughly with Next.js 15 App Router
- Follow TipTap official React documentation

### Rollback

- Remove TipTap packages from package.json
- Delete test component and test page
- No database changes required (this is frontend only)

### Improvements Checklist

All items below are **future enhancements** (not blocking):

- [ ] Consider adding automated unit tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] Add E2E tests for keyboard shortcuts using Playwright
- [ ] Consider extracting editor configuration to separate config file
- [ ] Add error boundary for graceful error handling
- [ ] Consider adding debounce to onChange for performance optimization in large documents

### Security Review

✅ **PASS - No Security Concerns**

- Component is client-side only, no server-side vulnerabilities
- Uses standard, well-maintained TipTap library (v3.6.6, actively maintained)
- No direct user input validation issues (TipTap handles this internally)
- No XSS vulnerabilities (React escaping + TipTap sanitization)
- No sensitive data handling
- Proper 'use client' directive prevents server-side execution

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASS - Good Performance**

**Strengths:**

- Smart content sync prevents infinite loops (JSON.stringify comparison in useEffect:104)
- Character count efficiently accessed via editor.storage
- Lazy initialization with `if (!editor) return null` prevents render issues
- Proper React hook dependencies minimize unnecessary re-renders

**Observations:**

- Large documents may benefit from onChange debouncing (future enhancement)
- JSON serialization is efficient for typical use cases
- TipTap's internal performance is excellent
