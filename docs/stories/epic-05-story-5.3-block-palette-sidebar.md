# Story 5.3: Build Block Palette Sidebar Component

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Drag-and-Drop Article Editor
**Story ID:** 5.3
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Agent Model Used:** claude-sonnet-4-5

---

## User Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** a sidebar palette showing all available block types,
**So that** I can easily add new blocks to my article by dragging them to the canvas.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Block type definitions (Story 5.2), TipTap editor foundation (Story 5.1)
- Technology: React 19, Next.js 15, @dnd-kit/core, Lucide React icons, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- Follows pattern: Component architecture in `components/editor/` directory
- Touch points: Will be used by Editor Canvas (Story 5.4), integrates with Zustand store for editor state

**Epic Context:**
This is the **third story** in Epic 5. It builds the Block Palette Sidebar UI that displays draggable block types using the type definitions from Story 5.2. This component is essential for Stories 5.4-5.12 as it provides the interface for adding blocks to articles.

**Dependencies:**

- Story 5.2: Block type definitions (BlockType union, type guards) ✅ Complete
- Story 5.1: TipTap foundation ✅ Complete
- Requires installation of @dnd-kit packages

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Component Creation:**
   - Block palette sidebar component created at `components/editor/block-palette.tsx`
   - Component is a React Server Component or Client Component (as needed for @dnd-kit)
   - Component exports default and is importable

2. **Block Type Display:**
   - Sidebar displays all 6 block types with icons and labels:
     - Heading (icon: Heading from Lucide)
     - Paragraph (icon: Type from Lucide)
     - Image (icon: Image from Lucide)
     - Quote (icon: Quote from Lucide)
     - List (icon: List from Lucide)
     - Divider (icon: Minus from Lucide)
   - Each block item shows icon + label in a clean, accessible layout

3. **Draggable Blocks:**
   - Each block is draggable using @dnd-kit/core's `useDraggable` hook
   - Drag handles are clearly indicated (cursor changes to `grab` on hover)
   - Dragging shows visual feedback (cursor changes to `grabbing`)

4. **Visual States:**
   - Hover state highlights block item with background color change
   - Active/pressed state when block is being dragged
   - Focus state for keyboard accessibility
   - All states follow design system colors

5. **Recently Used Section:**
   - Section header: "Recently Used"
   - Displays top 3 most recently used block types
   - Falls back to empty state message if no recent blocks: "No recent blocks yet"
   - Recent blocks tracked in editor state (Zustand store)

6. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - Sidebar collapsible on mobile with hamburger icon button
   - Collapsed state shows only icons (no labels)
   - Expand/collapse animation smooth (using Tailwind transitions or Framer Motion)
   - Toggle button fixed position, always accessible

7. **Layout & Positioning:**
   - Sidebar fixed position on desktop (left side, full height)
   - Sidebar overlay on mobile (slides in from left)
   - Desktop width: 280px
   - Mobile width: 240px
   - Proper z-index for mobile overlay (above canvas, below modals)

8. **Search Input Placeholder:**
   - Search input field at top of palette
   - Placeholder text: "Search blocks..."
   - Input disabled with tooltip: "Coming soon"
   - Styled consistently with design system

9. **Accessibility:**
   - All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Space)
   - Focus indicators visible
   - Screen reader announces block types and actions

### Integration Requirements

10. **Type Safety:**
    - Component uses BlockType union from `@/types/blocks`
    - All block data typed correctly
    - TypeScript strict mode passes with no errors

11. **State Management:**
    - Recently used blocks tracked in Zustand editor store
    - Store actions: `addRecentBlock(type: BlockType)`, `getRecentBlocks()`
    - Mobile collapsed state persisted in localStorage (optional enhancement)

12. **Existing Patterns:**
    - Follows component structure from `components/media/` (shadcn/ui patterns)
    - Uses existing UI components: Button, Card, Input (if applicable)
    - Consistent styling with media library components

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure Example

```typescript
'use client'

import { useDraggable } from '@dnd-kit/core'
import { Heading, Type, Image, Quote, List, Minus } from 'lucide-react'
import { BlockType } from '@/types/blocks'

interface BlockPaletteItem {
  type: BlockType
  icon: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>
  label: string
}

const blockPaletteItems: BlockPaletteItem[] = [
  { type: 'heading', icon: Heading, label: 'Heading' },
  { type: 'paragraph', icon: Type, label: 'Paragraph' },
  { type: 'image', icon: Image, label: 'Image' },
  { type: 'quote', icon: Quote, label: 'Quote' },
  { type: 'list', icon: List, label: 'List' },
  { type: 'divider', icon: Minus, label: 'Divider' },
]

export default function BlockPalette() {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Draggable Implementation Example

```typescript
function DraggableBlock({ type, icon: Icon, label }: BlockPaletteItem) {
  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({
    id: `palette-${type}`,
    data: { blockType: type },
  })

  const style = transform
    ? {
        transform: `translate3d(${transform.x}px, ${transform.y}px, 0)`,
      }
    : undefined

  return (
    <div
      ref={setNodeRef}
      style={style}
      {...listeners}
      {...attributes}
      className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-accent cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing"
    >
      <Icon className="w-5 h-5" />
      <span className="text-sm font-medium">{label}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Zustand Store Slice Example

```typescript
interface EditorState {
  recentBlocks: BlockType[]
  addRecentBlock: (type: BlockType) => void
  getRecentBlocks: () => BlockType[]
}

// In store definition
recentBlocks: [],
addRecentBlock: (type) =>
  set((state) => ({
    recentBlocks: [type, ...state.recentBlocks.filter((t) => t !== type)].slice(0, 3),
  })),
getRecentBlocks: () => get().recentBlocks,
```

### Integration Approach

- Component will be imported by Editor Canvas (Story 5.4)
- DndContext will wrap both palette and canvas
- Draggable blocks will transfer data via `data-block-type` attribute
- Recent blocks updated when block is added to canvas (Story 5.4+)

### Key Constraints

- Must use @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop (not HTML5 drag API)
- Must follow Shadcn/ui component patterns
- Search functionality is placeholder only (not functional)
- Recently used is basic array, no persistence required initially

---

## Risk and Compatibility

### Primary Risk

@dnd-kit setup complexity may cause integration issues with React 19 Server Components.

### Mitigation

- Use 'use client' directive for block-palette.tsx
- Test drag functionality immediately after setup
- Refer to @dnd-kit documentation for React 19 compatibility
- Keep palette component simple initially (no complex state logic)

### Secondary Risk

Mobile overlay may have z-index conflicts with existing modals (media library).

### Mitigation

- Use Tailwind z-index scale consistently (z-40 for overlay, z-50 for modals)
- Test palette alongside media library modal
- Document z-index usage in technical notes

### Rollback

- Uninstall @dnd-kit packages if not working
- Delete `components/editor/block-palette.tsx`
- No database changes required
- No impact on existing functionality

### Improvements Checklist

All items below are **future enhancements** (not blocking):

- [ ] Consider localStorage persistence for mobile sidebar collapsed state (UX enhancement)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K or /) to focus search when implemented
- [ ] Consider block preview tooltip/popover on hover for visual context
- [ ] Add drag preview overlay (custom drag image) for better visual feedback
- [ ] Consider adding block categories/groups if palette grows beyond 10-12 blocks

### Security Review

✅ **PASS - No Security Concerns**

- Client-side UI component with no data handling
- No API calls or external data sources
- No user input beyond interaction (clicking, dragging)
- Store state is ephemeral (no persistence layer yet)
- No XSS concerns (all content is static, typed constants)

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASS - Excellent Performance**

**Strengths:**

- Lightweight component (~230 lines, minimal complexity)
- Zustand store has minimal overhead (< 1KB)
- CSS transforms for drag animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Efficient conditional rendering for Recently Used section
- No unnecessary re-renders (Zustand selectors used correctly)
- Static block items array (no runtime computation)

**Observations:**

- Mobile overlay uses `bg-black/50` (Tailwind opacity) - renders efficiently
- Transition duration 300ms is optimal (not too fast, not too slow)
- Z-index hierarchy properly documented (z-30 overlay, z-40 sidebar, z-50 toggle)
