# Story 5.5: Create Sortable Block Wrapper Component

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Drag-and-Drop Article Editor
**Story ID:** 5.5
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Agent Model Used:** claude-sonnet-4-5

## User Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a sortable block wrapper that handles drag interactions,
**So that** each block can be dragged, selected, and managed individually.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Editor Canvas (Story 5.4), Block Renderer (Story 5.6)
- Technology: React 19, Next.js 15, @dnd-kit/sortable, Zustand
- Follows pattern: Component architecture in `components/editor/` directory
- Touch points: Wraps all blocks in canvas, manages selection state, provides drag handles

**Epic Context:**
This is the **fifth story** in Epic 5. It creates the SortableBlock wrapper component that makes individual blocks draggable and interactive. This component wraps each block in the canvas, providing the drag handle, selection highlighting, and action buttons (Settings, Duplicate, Delete). It bridges the gap between the DndContext (Story 5.4) and individual block content (Story 5.6+).

**Dependencies:**

- Story 5.2: Block type definitions (AnyBlock interface) ✅ Complete
- Story 5.4: Editor Canvas with DndContext ✅ Complete
- @dnd-kit/sortable already installed in Story 5.3 ✅

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Component Creation:**
   - SortableBlock component created at `components/editor/sortable-block.tsx`
   - Component accepts block data as prop
   - Component accepts children (block content renderer)
   - Component is a Client Component ('use client' directive)

2. **Sortable Hook Integration:**
   - Uses `useSortable` hook from @dnd-kit/sortable
   - Properly configured with block ID
   - Transform and transition styles applied for smooth drag
   - isDragging state tracked

3. **Drag Handle:**
   - Drag handle visible on hover (left side of block)
   - Uses GripVertical icon from lucide-react
   - Cursor changes to `grab` on hover
   - Cursor changes to `grabbing` while dragging
   - Drag handle only visible on non-touch devices (hidden on mobile)

4. **Block Selection:**
   - Click anywhere on block selects it
   - Selected block shows blue border (primary color)
   - Selection updates Zustand editor store (setSelectedBlock)
   - Only one block selected at a time
   - Selected state visually distinct

5. **Block Action Buttons:**
   - Action buttons visible on hover (right side of block)
   - Three buttons: Settings, Duplicate, Delete
   - Settings button: Gear icon, opens inspector panel
   - Duplicate button: Copy icon, duplicates block
   - Delete button: Trash icon, deletes block with confirmation
   - Buttons styled with hover states

6. **Drag Visual Feedback:**
   - Dragging block shows semi-transparent preview (opacity: 0.5)
   - Drop indicator line shows where block will be inserted
   - Non-dragging blocks shift to make space for drop
   - Smooth CSS transitions during drag

7. **Accessibility:**
   - Block wrapper keyboard selectable (Tab navigation)
   - Enter key selects block
   - Space/Enter on delete button triggers confirmation
   - ARIA labels for drag handle and action buttons
   - Selected block announced to screen readers

8. **Touch Device Support:**
   - Drag handle hidden on touch devices
   - Long-press initiates drag on mobile
   - Action buttons accessible via tap on mobile
   - Selection works with single tap

9. **Delete Confirmation:**
   - Delete button shows confirmation dialog
   - Confirmation uses AlertDialog from shadcn/ui
   - Cancel and Confirm buttons
   - Pressing Confirm removes block from store

10. **Duplicate Functionality:**
    - Duplicate button creates copy of block
    - New block inserted immediately after original
    - New block gets unique ID (crypto.randomUUID)
    - Duplicate preserves all block data

### Integration Requirements

11. **Zustand Store Integration:**
    - Uses `selectedBlockId` from editor store
    - Calls `setSelectedBlock(id)` on click
    - Calls `deleteBlock(id)` on delete confirm
    - Calls `addBlock(duplicatedBlock)` on duplicate
    - Store actions properly update blocks array

12. **Type Safety:**
    - Component props properly typed (block: AnyBlock, children: ReactNode)
    - useSortable hook properly typed
    - TypeScript strict mode compliance
    - No type errors in build

13. **Existing Patterns:**
    - Uses shadcn/ui components (AlertDialog, Button)
    - Uses lucide-react icons (GripVertical, Settings, Copy, Trash2)
    - Follows Tailwind utility class patterns
    - Consistent spacing and colors with design system

### Quality Requirements

14. **Performance:**
    - Component re-renders only when block data or selection changes
    - Drag operations smooth (60fps)
    - No layout shift during drag
    - Action buttons render efficiently

15. **Testing:**
    - Component renders without errors
    - Drag handle initiates drag (manual test)
    - Selection updates on click (manual test)
    - Delete confirmation works (manual test)
    - Duplicate creates new block (manual test)

16. **Documentation:**
    - JSDoc comments for component and props
    - Usage example in component file header
    - Code comments explain drag handle logic
    - File List updated in this story

## Technical Notes

### SortableBlock Component Structure

```typescript
'use client'

import { useSortable } from '@dnd-kit/sortable'
import { CSS } from '@dnd-kit/utilities'
import { useEditorStore } from '@/lib/stores/editor-store'
import { GripVertical, Settings, Copy, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react'
import { useState } from 'react'
import type { AnyBlock } from '@/types/blocks'

interface SortableBlockProps {
  block: AnyBlock
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export default function SortableBlock({ block, children }: SortableBlockProps) {
  const { selectedBlockId, setSelectedBlock, deleteBlock, addBlock } = useEditorStore()
  const [showDeleteDialog, setShowDeleteDialog] = useState(false)

  const {
    attributes,
    listeners,
    setNodeRef,
    transform,
    transition,
    isDragging,
  } = useSortable({ id: block.id })

  const style = {
    transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform),
    transition,
    opacity: isDragging ? 0.5 : 1,
  }

  const isSelected = selectedBlockId === block.id

  function handleSelect() {
    setSelectedBlock(block.id)
  }

  function handleDuplicate() {
    const duplicatedBlock = {
      ...block,
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      order: block.order + 1,
    }
    addBlock(duplicatedBlock)
  }

  function handleDelete() {
    deleteBlock(block.id)
    setShowDeleteDialog(false)
  }

  return (
    <div
      ref={setNodeRef}
      style={style}
      onClick={handleSelect}
      className={cn(
        'group relative rounded-lg border bg-background p-4 transition-all',
        isSelected && 'border-primary ring-2 ring-primary/20',
        !isSelected && 'border-border hover:border-muted-foreground/50'
      )}
    >
      {/* Drag Handle */}
      <button
        {...attributes}
        {...listeners}
        className="absolute left-0 top-1/2 hidden -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 cursor-grab opacity-0 transition-opacity group-hover:opacity-100 sm:block active:cursor-grabbing"
        aria-label="Drag to reorder"
      >
        <GripVertical className="h-5 w-5 text-muted-foreground" />
      </button>

      {/* Block Content */}
      {children}

      {/* Action Buttons */}
      <div className="absolute right-2 top-2 flex gap-1 opacity-0 transition-opacity group-hover:opacity-100">
        <Button size="icon" variant="ghost" onClick={() => {/* Open inspector */}}>
          <Settings className="h-4 w-4" />
        </Button>
        <Button size="icon" variant="ghost" onClick={handleDuplicate}>
          <Copy className="h-4 w-4" />
        </Button>
        <Button size="icon" variant="ghost" onClick={() => setShowDeleteDialog(true)}>
          <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4" />
        </Button>
      </div>

      {/* Delete Confirmation Dialog */}
      <AlertDialog open={showDeleteDialog} onOpenChange={setShowDeleteDialog}>
        <AlertDialogContent>
          <AlertDialogHeader>
            <AlertDialogTitle>Delete Block?</AlertDialogTitle>
            <AlertDialogDescription>
              Are you sure you want to delete this block? This action cannot be undone.
            </AlertDialogDescription>
          </AlertDialogHeader>
          <AlertDialogFooter>
            <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
            <AlertDialogAction onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</AlertDialogAction>
          </AlertDialogFooter>
        </AlertDialogContent>
      </AlertDialog>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Integration with EditorCanvas

```typescript
// In editor-canvas.tsx
import SortableBlock from './sortable-block'
import BlockRenderer from './block-renderer' // Story 5.6

{blocks.map((block) => (
  <SortableBlock key={block.id} block={block}>
    <BlockRenderer block={block} />
  </SortableBlock>
))}
```

### Zustand Store Actions Required

Already implemented in Story 5.4:

- `selectedBlockId: string | null` ✅
- `setSelectedBlock: (id: string | null) => void` ✅
- `addBlock: (block: AnyBlock) => void` ✅
- `deleteBlock: (id: string) => void` ✅

### CSS Transform Utilities

@dnd-kit provides CSS utilities for smooth transforms:

```typescript
import { CSS } from '@dnd-kit/utilities'

const style = {
  transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform),
  transition,
}
```

### Accessibility Considerations

- Drag handle has aria-label="Drag to reorder"
- Action buttons have aria-labels (Settings, Duplicate, Delete)
- Block wrapper is keyboard focusable (tabIndex={0})
- Enter key selects block
- AlertDialog from shadcn/ui is already accessible

### Touch Device Optimization

- Drag handle hidden with `hidden sm:block` (visible on screens ≥640px)
- @dnd-kit automatically handles long-press drag on touch devices
- Action buttons work with tap (no hover required)
- Selection works with single tap

### Delete Confirmation Pattern

Using shadcn/ui AlertDialog for confirmation:

- Prevents accidental deletions
- Accessible with keyboard (Esc to cancel, Enter to confirm)
- Follows design system patterns
- Clear Cancel/Delete actions

---

---

## Risk and Compatibility

### Primary Risk

Drag handle event listeners may conflict with block selection onClick events.

### Mitigation

- Attach listeners only to drag handle button, not entire block
- Use stopPropagation in action button handlers
- Test click vs drag scenarios thoroughly
- Ensure selection doesn't trigger during drag (check isDragging state)

### Secondary Risk

Delete action may be triggered accidentally without confirmation.

### Mitigation

- Always show AlertDialog before deleting
- Use destructive styling for delete button
- Clear "Cancel" option in dialog
- Consider adding Cmd/Ctrl+Z undo (Story 5.11)

### Rollback

- Remove sortable-block.tsx
- Revert editor-canvas.tsx to render blocks without wrapper
- No database changes required
- No store changes required (uses existing actions)
