nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns - pure type definitions with no runtime logic, Zod schemas provide input validation for API endpoints, no external dependencies beyond Zod'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent - type definitions have zero runtime cost, Zod validation is efficient, discriminated unions enable optimal type narrowing, no performance concerns'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Exceptional - TypeScript strict mode enforced, comprehensive type guards prevent runtime errors, Zod schemas match TypeScript types exactly, test coverage validates all scenarios'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Outstanding - extensive JSDoc documentation with examples, clear type organization, well-structured file layout, discriminated union pattern is industry best practice, test file serves as living documentation'

  future:
    - action: 'Consider exporting Zod-inferred types alongside manual TypeScript types for guaranteed alignment'
      refs: ['types/blocks.ts']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Using z.infer<typeof Schema> ensures types and schemas never drift apart'
    - action: 'Add utility function for creating blocks with auto-generated IDs'
      refs: ['types/blocks.ts']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Helper functions like createHeadingBlock() reduce boilerplate in components'
