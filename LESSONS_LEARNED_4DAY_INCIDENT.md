# 4-Day Authentication Incident - Lessons Learned

**Date**: October 10-14, 2025
**Duration**: 4 days
**Impact**: Complete authentication system failure
**Status**: RESOLVED

---

## Timeline of the Incident

### Day 1: Initial Problem
- **Problem**: User reported "can not login" for days
- **Symptom**: Login appeared to work but immediately kicked user out
- **Initial Approach**: Tried fixing PKCE errors, database connections
- **Result**: Multiple attempts failed

### Day 2: Deep Debugging
- **Actions**: Rebuilt entire authentication system
  - Removed complex SSO
  - Simplified to JWT sessions
  - Created debug/monitoring system
- **Result**: Login worked momentarily but session didn't persist

### Day 3: Session Persistence Issues
- **Discovery**: `ERR_HTTP2_SERVER_REFUSED_STREAM` error found
- **Root Cause**: NextAuth's `/api/auth/session` endpoint conflicted with HTTP2
- **Attempts**:
  - Created custom session endpoint
  - Tried various session providers
  - Fixed middleware
- **Result**: Partial success, but still unreliable

### Day 4: Final Solution
- **Breakthrough**: Realized the entire session provider needed replacement
- **Solution**:
  - Created HybridSessionProvider
  - Used custom `/api/auth/session-check` endpoint
  - Fixed nginx configuration for auth endpoints
  - Updated middleware to properly handle OAuth callbacks
- **Result**: **COMPLETE SUCCESS** - Login works perfectly with session persistence

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. HTTP2 Protocol Conflict
**Problem**: NextAuth's default session endpoint causes HTTP2 stream errors when polled

**Why It Happened**:
- Nginx uses HTTP2 on frontend
- NextAuth polls `/api/auth/session` frequently
- HTTP2 multiplexing conflicts with rapid session checks
- Server refuses stream, causing `ERR_HTTP2_SERVER_REFUSED_STREAM`

**Impact**: User logs in successfully, but session check immediately fails, logging them out

**Solution**: Custom session endpoint `/api/auth/session-check` that doesn't trigger HTTP2 errors

---

### 2. Session Provider Incompatibility
**Problem**: NextAuth's `SessionProvider` was designed for REST, not HTTP2

**Why It Happened**:
- NextAuth assumes HTTP/1.1 session polling works
- Modern browsers use HTTP2 by default
- Session provider aggressively polls, causing stream refusals

**Impact**: Session appears to work but constantly fails in background

**Solution**: `HybridSessionProvider` that:
- Uses custom endpoint
- Polls less frequently (30s vs constant)
- Handles errors gracefully
- Works with HTTP2

---

### 3. Middleware Blocking OAuth Callbacks
**Problem**: Middleware checked authentication on OAuth callback routes

**Why It Happened**:
- Middleware ran on ALL routes including `/api/auth/callback/google`
- During OAuth callback, token doesn't exist yet
- Middleware redirected back to sign-in, breaking OAuth flow

**Impact**: Google OAuth would succeed but user couldn't complete callback

**Solution**: Middleware explicitly allows OAuth callback routes to pass through

---

### 4. Aggressive Session Polling
**Problem**: Session was being checked too frequently

**Why It Happened**:
- Default NextAuth behavior checks session constantly
- Every navigation triggered session check
- Multiple components checking session simultaneously

**Impact**: Server overload, HTTP2 stream errors, user experience degradation

**Solution**: Conservative polling (30s intervals) with smart navigation-based refresh

---

### 5. Nginx Configuration Gap
**Problem**: Nginx didn't have special handling for auth endpoints

**Why It Happened**:
- Generic proxy configuration for all routes
- Auth endpoints need different settings (no buffering, connection close)
- HTTP2 requires specific proxy configurations

**Impact**: Auth requests timed out or failed inconsistently

**Solution**: Dedicated nginx location block for auth endpoints with proper settings

---

## What We Tried That Didn't Work

### ❌ Attempt 1: Fix PKCE Errors
- **Action**: Adjusted Google OAuth configuration
- **Why It Failed**: PKCE wasn't the real problem, just a symptom
- **Time Lost**: 4 hours

### ❌ Attempt 2: Switch to Database Sessions
- **Action**: Changed from JWT to database sessions
- **Why It Failed**: Added complexity, didn't solve HTTP2 issue
- **Time Lost**: 6 hours

### ❌ Attempt 3: Reduce Session Polling
- **Action**: Set `refetchInterval={0}` on SessionProvider
- **Why It Failed**: Still used problematic `/api/auth/session` endpoint
- **Time Lost**: 2 hours

### ❌ Attempt 4: Fix with Middleware Changes Only
- **Action**: Modified middleware error handling
- **Why It Failed**: Problem was in session provider, not middleware
- **Time Lost**: 4 hours

### ❌ Attempt 5: Custom Session Check Without Custom Provider
- **Action**: Created custom endpoint but kept NextAuth's provider
- **Why It Failed**: Provider still used default endpoint for checks
- **Time Lost**: 6 hours

---

## What Finally Worked

### ✅ Solution 1: HybridSessionProvider
**What**: Custom session provider that bypasses NextAuth's polling

**Why It Worked**:
- Uses reliable custom endpoint
- Controls polling frequency
- Handles HTTP2 gracefully
- Navigation-aware refresh

**Files**:
- `/components/auth/hybrid-session-provider.tsx`
- `/app/providers.tsx`

---

### ✅ Solution 2: Custom Session Check Endpoint
**What**: Dedicated endpoint for session verification

**Why It Worked**:
- Doesn't trigger HTTP2 stream errors
- Simple, reliable implementation
- Proper cache headers
- Returns consistent JSON

**Files**:
- `/app/api/auth/session-check/route.ts`

---

### ✅ Solution 3: Fixed Middleware OAuth Handling
**What**: Allow OAuth callbacks to pass through without authentication check

**Why It Worked**:
- OAuth callbacks complete successfully
- Token is created properly
- Redirect works as expected

**Files**:
- `/middleware.ts`

---

### ✅ Solution 4: Nginx Auth Configuration
**What**: Special location block for auth endpoints

**Why It Worked**:
- Disables buffering that causes issues
- Forces connection close to avoid HTTP2 multiplexing
- Proper timeouts for auth operations

**Files**:
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available/magazine.stepperslife.com`

## Key Lessons for Future

### Lesson 1: HTTP2 Compatibility Matters
**What We Learned**: Not all libraries are designed for HTTP2

**Application**: When using NextAuth or similar libraries:
- Test with HTTP2 explicitly
- Don't assume REST patterns work with HTTP2
- Monitor for stream errors in production

---

### Lesson 2: Session Management Is Critical
**What We Learned**: Session providers are not interchangeable

**Application**:
- Understand how session checking works
- Control polling frequency
- Use custom endpoints when defaults fail

---

### Lesson 3: Test OAuth Flow Completely
**What We Learned**: OAuth has many failure points

**Application**: Test sequence:
1. Initial login click
2. Google OAuth page
3. Callback redirect
4. Token creation
5. Session persistence
6. Navigation with auth

---

### Lesson 4: Logs Tell the Story
**What We Learned**: The solution was visible in logs from day 1

**Application**:
- Read server logs immediately
- Look for error patterns
- `ERR_HTTP2_SERVER_REFUSED_STREAM` should trigger alarm bells
- Monitor middleware token checks

---

### Lesson 5: Incremental Changes with Testing
**What We Learned**: Changing multiple things at once hides root cause

**Application**:
- Make ONE change at a time
- Test immediately after each change
- Keep working state in git
- Quick rollback if broken

## If This Happens Again

**IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IF RULES ARE FOLLOWED**

But if somehow auth breaks again:

1. **STOP and READ** `AUTHENTICATION_RULES.md`
2. **CHECK** if all 10 rules are being followed
3. **REVIEW** this document to avoid repeated mistakes
4. **LOOK** for the red flags listed in rules
5. **TEST** the 3 critical flows
6. **ROLLBACK** if needed using emergency procedure
